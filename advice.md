# Advice

Just a repository for advice from _moi_ to _vous_.

To be ready for the lab quiz next week, I'd suggest:
- having **at least** all of the week-01 drills done. If you're stuck, you need to ask questions either of JP or your cohort, pronto.
- practicing the "import a quiz repository from GitHub Classroom into Eclipse" procedure until you can do it quickly and without hesitation
- doing the 2 practice quizzes **under time pressure** to see what gaps in your understanding their are. Then fill in those gaps by watching the screencasts and asking JP or your cohort any questions you have.
