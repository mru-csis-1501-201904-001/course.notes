# Advice

Just a repository for advice from _moi_ to _vous_.

- As noted in the [lec.05](lecture.and.lab.notes/09.18.lec.05.md) and [lab.04](lecture.and.lab.notes/09.20.lab.04.md) notes, you should learn the syntax for Java if statements on your own - it's pretty darn close to the pseudocode versions.

  You are only expected to know how to **read** simple conditions (those not using && and ||) in Java, not write them.

- Don't forget to look at my solutions from time to time when you finish drills!

Practice tracing code on a regular basis. This can be as simple as tracing what happens in your own drill code: when you're working on a drill, every now and then ask yourself "what will happen in this method if I have these parameter values"?

Get into the habit of looking through the lecture or lab notes for the upcoming day (or days, if JP has multiple days done in advance). That way, when you come to lecture/lab, you're actually **reviewing** and **reinforcing** things you're already gone over instead of learning new stuff.

To be ready for the lab quiz next week, I'd suggest:

- having **at least** all of the week-01 drills done. If you're stuck, you need to ask questions either of JP or your cohort, pronto.
- practicing the "import a quiz repository from GitHub Classroom into Eclipse" procedure until you can do it quickly and without hesitation
- doing the 2 practice quizzes **under time pressure** to see what gaps in your understanding their are. Then fill in those gaps by watching the screencasts and asking JP or your cohort any questions you have.
