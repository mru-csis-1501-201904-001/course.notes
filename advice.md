- If you did not get an A or A+ on your quiz...redo it until you do. I'm serious. If you're stuck on something, ask for help - either from me or a classmate. If you had **any** issues getting started, or running tests, or submitting...ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES before the next lab quiz!

- The most effective way to "study" for this course? Solve lots of problems, preferably to the Java code stage, but even just working to the natural language algorithm or pseudocode stage is helpful. The textbook is a fanttastic resource for this: its review questions and practice exercise sections are great because of their variety and their marked difficulty levels. The programming projects are good places to practice too, though they can take a while to work through, particularly the higher-difficulty ones. If you haven't purchased the text, remember that there are two copies on reserve at the Library.
- Reading code - and preferable tracing through it, even if only in your head or on paper - is an equally effective study method. What code is there available to read? Anything from drills (my code, your code, a friend's code), practice quizzes, old midterms...it's all good. Ask yourself questions like "if these inputs were passed into this method, what would come out?" and "if the user inputs these values at the keyboard, what will happen?".

- As noted in the [lec.05](lecture.and.lab.notes/09.18.lec.05.md) and [lab.04](lecture.and.lab.notes/09.20.lab.04.md) notes, you should learn the syntax for Java if statements on your own - it's pretty darn close to the pseudocode versions.

  You are only expected to know how to **read** simple conditions (those not using && and ||) in Java, not write them.

- Don't forget to look at my solutions from time to time when you finish drills!

Practice tracing code on a regular basis. This can be as simple as tracing what happens in your own drill code: when you're working on a drill, every now and then ask yourself "what will happen in this method if I have these parameter values"?

Get into the habit of looking through the lecture or lab notes for the upcoming day (or days, if JP has multiple days done in advance). That way, when you come to lecture/lab, you're actually **reviewing** and **reinforcing** things you're already gone over instead of learning new stuff.

To be ready for the lab quiz next week, I'd suggest:

- having **at least** all of the week-01 drills done. If you're stuck, you need to ask questions either of JP or your cohort, pronto.
- practicing the "import a quiz repository from GitHub Classroom into Eclipse" procedure until you can do it quickly and without hesitation
- doing the 2 practice quizzes **under time pressure** to see what gaps in your understanding their are. Then fill in those gaps by watching the screencasts and asking JP or your cohort any questions you have.
