# Can You Do These Things?

## Preamble

This is a list of things that you should know how to do at this time. If there's anything in here you don't know how to do, you should figure it out by getting help from somewhere or someone. (Folks in your class and your instructor are good places to start. The web is OK, but finding useful help can be time-consuming.)
