## [SEP-18] Lec-05: Tracing pseudocode containing conditions & methods

We'll trace a more complex piece of pseudocode and introduce conditions (non-nested if/else if/else)

### the card game problem

- [ ] group up and compare your solutions for [this question](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fAaPbr5HMy6NDYAZAV087kJd2vb6P2Dtxhn2z9kb02s/edit?usp=sharing)
- [ ] what new things do we see here?
  - [ ] if (condition) then / else if (condition) then / else
    - [ ] conditions evaluate to TRUE or FALSE
    - [ ] conditions can be simple, or have an AND in them (OR would be possible, too)
    - [ ] `!` represents NOT
  - [ ] questions may provide methods for certain special variables; very similar to how a String has methods like length(), toUpperCase(), etc
    - [ ] `top` method is a bit weird, isn't it?

### Review

- [ ] write some natural-language/pseudocode ifs with conditions (ones with and ones without AND/OR/!) for situations you find in real life. For example: `if (you buy a lottery ticket AND that ticket is a winner) then you will have lots of money`
- [ ] write some methods that you might find on the following things:
  - [ ] a dice
  - [ ] a sack
  - [ ] a bank account
  - [ ] a cage

### Terms

- [ ] pseudocode versions of
  - [ ] if/else if/else
  - [ ] simple conditions (=, !=, >, <, >=, <=)
  - [ ] conditions with AND / OR / !
