# 1501-001 Lab Notes

## [SEP-17] Lab-03

### Topics to cover

- [ ] integer div / mod
- [ ] nextInt/nextDouble => nextLine gotcha
- [ ] tracing

### integer div/mod

- [ ] do some division that works as expected (4 / 2, 120/10, …)
- [ ] do some division that doesn't work as expected (4/8, 20/7)
- [ ] "how many _full_ clumps of size <denom> can you make from <num> things"? [draw]
- [ ] sometimes we want to know how many are left over => introduce %
- [ ] sometimes you just wanna frickin' divide 4/8 and get 0.5 … here's how

### nextInt/Double => nextLine gotcha

- look at this REPL <https://repl.it/@jpratt/lab03nextLinegotcha>

### tracing

- [ ] trace this code:

```java
int x = 7 / 2;

int y = (int)(4.0 * x);

int z = Math.min(13, y);

y = x * x;

x += z;

z = 2 * z;

System.out.println(y + ":" + x + ":" + z);

```

- [ ] trace the result of running `run()`; assume that **hi there!** is entered at the keyboard:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

class TraceApp {

    void run() {
        Scanner kbd = new Scanner(System.in);
        String input = kbd.next();

        int x = TraceUtil.process(input);

        System.out.println(input + " => " + x);
    }
}

class TraceUtil {

    public static int process(String s) {
        return Math.max(6, s.length());

    }
}

```

## Lab Lookback

### Review

- [ ] what is the value of 6 / 12 in Java? Why?
- [ ] if you had some integer variable `eggsOnHand` and wanted to find out how many eggs would be left over after putting what eggs you could in egg cartons (that hold 12 eggs each), what Java expression would you use?
- [ ] what happens when you do a nextLine() right after a nextInt()/nextDouble()?
- [ ] what is a powerful technique that you can use to understand how code works and to solve run-time errors?

### Terms

- [ ] trace
- [ ] div (/)
- [ ] mod (%)
