# 1501-001 Lecture Notes

## [SEP-12] Lec-03: Gear Down

Take a bit of a break here, given the anxiety levels of a goodly portion of the class.

### about drills

- [ ] each one is worth a small amount of marks, so try not to stress over any individual one
- [ ] primary value of drills is not the marks, but the coding experience they give you
- [ ] suggestions about syntax errors in drills (work with the first error first, sometimes line number is off, read the message - they give useful clues)

### challenge 2 (Tipsy)

- [ ] the goal: make a method that calculates a reasonable tip
  - [ ] is this problem well-specified? how can we tell?
    - [ ] anyone wait tables here?
    - [ ] what's a reasonable tip %?
  - [ ] build examples
  - [ ] use examples to create assumptions => write 'em down
  - [ ] we'll go with restrictions/assumptions that make our life easy...but I challenge you to do these variants:
    - [ ] you get a total _including_ GST
    - [ ] same as above, but method now also needs to take in the tip % (as an integer)
  - [ ] we'll again build our method in 3 steps: algorithm (natural language), algorithm (pseudocode), and Java code - testing as we go along
- [ ] step 1: algorithm (natural language)
  - [ ] **group task**: build your algorithm in natural language
  - [ ] **task**: test!
- [ ] step 2: algorithm (pseudocode)
  - [ ] **group task**: build your algorithm in pseudocode
  - [ ] **task**: test!
- [ ] step 3: Java code
  - [ ] **action**: build the code from the pseudocode
  - [ ] final result here: <https://repl.it/@jpratt/lec02TipsyApp>
  - [ ] **task**: test!
- [ ] review: Java stuff covered
  - [ ] our Main / App / Utility pattern
  - [ ] method parameters
  - [ ] value returning method (compare to **void** method)
  - [ ] concatenation
  - [ ] using String.format("%.#f", value) to round value to # decimal places [covered in screencast]

---

### Review

- [ ] assume we have a variable `double atomicWeight` that you want to display to 5 decimal places. How could you do this? [assumed you've watched the screencast on String.format]
- [ ] what `arithmetic operators` are available to you in Java? (For example, + and - are two of them...)

### Terms

- [ ] String.format
- [ ] arithmetic operator
