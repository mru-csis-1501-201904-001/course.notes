# 1501-001 Lecture Notes

## [SEP-23] Lec-07: Practice making classes; scope

### Topics to cover

- [ ] instance variables (text 8.2, 8.4)
- [ ] constructors (text 8.6)
- [ ] instance methods (text 8.5)
- [ ] public interface (text 8.3)
- [ ] variable scope (text 5.8)

### revisit our TapeMeasure class

- [ ] let's recall the **public interface** of our TapeMeasure class by listing its **instance methods** (behaviour) and **instance variables** (state)
  - [ ] when we created the `tp` and `greenAndBlack` variables, we could have called those **instances** of class TapeMeasure
- [ ] let's complete the coding of our public interface
- [ ] we'll bump into the concepts of scope, `this`, and constructor
  - [ ] introduce the "rule" that instance variables should always be **private** (we'll go into private and public more next week)
  - [ ] introduce scoping notation suggestion; how are parameters, instance variables, and if statements handled?
- [ ] final source code available at <https://repl.it/@jpratt/TapeMeasureExample>

### group work: TallyCounter

- [ ] form random groups of 3
- [ ] introduce tally counter concept (text 8.2) and wrapping concept
- [ ] **task [5 min]:** decide on the public interface (behaviour) of your TallyCounter class and instance variables (state)
  - [ ] provide return type + signature
  - [ ] name things well (void=>start with verb; non-void=>name should indicate what's being returned)
- [ ] share results

---

## Lecture Lookback

Didn't get a chance to discuss scope, nor work on TallyCounter - kick down the road to week-04.

### Review

- [ ] what's the primary job of a constructor?
- [ ] go back through some drills and list the public interface of every class but Main; provide return type and signature of each public method

### Terms

- [ ] instance
- [ ] instance variable
- [ ] instance method
- [ ] public interface
- [ ] constructor
