# 1501-001 Lab Notes

## [SEP-27] Lab-06

### Before we begin

### Topics to cover

- [ ] REPL.IT drill gotcha
- [ ] reading tests for week-04 drills
- [ ] introducing A1

## REPL.IT "feature"

- [ ] if you `run`, then `run tests`...any further `run` will show errors in the tests!
  - [ ] one fix: just reload the page, but a better fix...
  - [ ] stub out the public interface! (good practice for quizzes, assignments, and real life, too)...this is a good segue to our next session

## reading test code

- [ ] let's look at the Bookshelf drill together
- [ ] go through the TESTS and using the skills you've built to determine return types and method signatures from method calls, stub out all the methods in the Bookshelf class INCLUDING the constructor!

> Pro Tip:
>
> You can copy/paste a single test into the `run()` and focus on making that one test pass (just println the second argument of the assertEquals)

- [ ] extra bonus: now you can run and run tests without issue

## introducing A1

- [ ] demo finished product
- [ ] biggest challenge in this one is the amount of reading and understanding the problem you have to do...not the coding itself
- [ ] amount of code
  - [ ] my finished Instruction class: 55 lines (includes spacing and method headers!)
  - [ ] my finished Result class: 19 lines
  - [ ] BrowserAutomationApp: ~50 lines?
  - [ ] Browzbot: ~ 200 lines?
  - [ ] UserInterface: ~5 lines?
- [ ] partial marks are easy...**don't** fall into the "all or nothing" mental trap that many students do
- [ ] I'd suggest a "bottom-up" approach: build the parts (testing as you go); once all the parts are ready, you can complete the App itself
