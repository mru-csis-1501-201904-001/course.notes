# 1501-001 Lecture Notes

## [OCT-02] Lec-11: back to objects; scope

### Before we start

- [ ] I've punted the assignment deadline down the road
- [ ] the "what's the **point**" question that came up in lab a few times yesterday

### Topics to cover

- [ ] variable scope (text 5.8)
- [ ] `this.` notation (text 8.9.3)

### scope scramble

- [ ] introduce scoping notation suggestion; how are parameters, instance variables, and if statements handled?
- [ ] using `this.` to talk about your instance variables
  - [ ] some people just use `this.` all the time so there is no doubt what's going on; you can try it out if you'd like - I'm fine with you doing that in terms of marking stuff
  - [ ] if you don't want to use it all the time, then you **do** still need to use it when you have a naming conflict (often happens in constructors)

### group work: TallyCounter (if time)

- [ ] introduce tally counter concept (text 8.2) and wrapping concept
- [ ] decide on the public interface (behaviour) of your TallyCounter class and instance variables (state)
  - [ ] provide return type + signature
  - [ ] name things well (void=>start with verb; non-void=>name should indicate what's being returned)
- [ ] share results

---

## Lecture Lookback

### Review

- [ ] implement (computer-speak for "code up") the TallyCounter class your group created
- [ ] go back through some drills and diagram the scope of variables (don't forget to do some parameters)

### Terms

- [ ] (variable) scope
- [ ] this. notation
