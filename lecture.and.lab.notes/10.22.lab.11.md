# 1501-001 Lab Notes

## [OCT-22] Lab-11

### Before we begin

- reminder to get those 2 loop-related drills out of the way
- any assignment questions?

### Topics to cover

- Pick up a few debugging pointers.

### DEBUGGING TIPS

#### Get to know common compile-time errors

It might not seem that way when you're first starting out, but compile-time errors are the "easy" errors - it's just that when you first start programming, the language is unfamiliar, so you make lots of minor mistakes that wind up creating these kind of errors.

Although you'll see a lot of different kinds of compile time errors during this course (and onward, perhaps?), some are more common than others.

Here is a useful guide to some of the more common ones: http://www.terryanderson.ca/debugging/compile.html

#### Be familiar with common run-time errors

Just because your code compiles, doesn't mean you're out of the woods yet. Sometimes, when you run a compiled program, it will blow up with an _exception_ of some sort. This is an example of a **run-time error**, and the come in many shapes an sizes.

When an exception occurs, you'll get an intimidating blast of text known as a **stack trace**, and these suckers are super useful in helping you find your errors.

#### STACK TRACES EXAMPLES

1. What happens when we run [this code](https://repl.it/@jpratt/StackTraceExampleOne) a number of different ways?

   - a first and last name
   - just a first (or last) name
   - a first, middle, and last name

1. What happens when we run [this code](https://repl.it/@jpratt/StackTraceExampleTwo)?

#### GENERAL STRATEGIES WHEN FACED WITH ERRORS

- always start with the first error; don't cherry pick ones that seem "easier", because often fixing the first error will fix some (or all!) of the following errors!
- **read** the entire error message, not just the line number (though that's important!), since it will often give you useful information
- use System.out.println to print out the values of variables in sections of code that you suspect might be broken; these kind of prints have a special name: **trace statements** - and they're **very** useful.
  - if you give each of your classes a useful `toString` that displays instance variable information, trace statements become even **more** useful!
- start looking for errors on the line of code that prints out the thing you don't like; that line will often lead you to another line, which leads to another...which will almost always lead you back to the root cause of your problem
