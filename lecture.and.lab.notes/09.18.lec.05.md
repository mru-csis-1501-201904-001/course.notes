## [SEP-18] Lec-05: Tracing pseudocode containing conditions & methods

We'll trace a more complex piece of pseudocode and introduce conditions (non-nested if/else if/else)

### Topics to cover

- [ ] addition of all Java String methods into our allowed pseudocode "language"
- [ ] additions to our pseudocode
  - [ ] if then / if then else / if then else if then else
  - [ ] relational operators (<, <=, >, >=, = , !=)
  - [ ] not operator (!)
  - [ ] simple conditions (numeric)
  - [ ] compound conditions using (AND / OR)
- [ ] additions to our Java syntax (students will research this on their own!)
  - [ ] if statement
    - [ ] (text 3.1, 3.3)
  - [ ] relational operators (<, <=, >, >=, == instead of ==, !=)
    - [ ] (text 3.2)
  - [ ] Boolean variables
    - [ ] (text 3.7)
  - [ ] Boolean operators (&&, ||, !)
    - [ ] (text 3.7)

### the card game problem

- [ ] group up and compare your solutions for [this question](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fAaPbr5HMy6NDYAZAV087kJd2vb6P2Dtxhn2z9kb02s/edit?usp=sharing)
- [ ] what new things do we see here?
  - [ ] if (condition) then / else if (condition) then / else
    - [ ] conditions evaluate to TRUE or FALSE
    - [ ] conditions can be simple, or have an AND in them (OR would be possible, too)
    - [ ] `!` represents NOT
  - [ ] questions may provide methods for certain special variables; very similar to how a String has methods like length(), toUpperCase(), etc
    - [ ] `top` method is a bit weird, isn't it?

### Review

- [ ] write some natural-language/pseudocode ifs with conditions (ones with and ones without AND/OR/!) for situations you find in real life. For example: `if (you buy a lottery ticket AND that ticket is a winner) then you will have lots of money`
- [ ] write some methods that you might find on the following things:
  - [ ] a dice
  - [ ] a sack
  - [ ] a bank account
  - [ ] a cage
- [ ] look up the Java syntax for if, if-else, and if-else if-else statements. Don't worry about conditions using &&,||, or ! for now.
  - [ ] section 3.1 & 3.3 in the text
  - [ ] Oracle's Java Tutorials has this: <https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/if.html> ... you might find better elsewhere online

### Terms

- [ ] Boolean variable
- [ ] true/false
- [ ] condition
- [ ] if statement
- [ ] relational operator (=, !=, >, <, >=, <=)
