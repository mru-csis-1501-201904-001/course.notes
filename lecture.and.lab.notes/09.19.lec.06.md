## [SEP-19] Lec-06: Utility classes & an introduction to objects

### Topics to cover

- [ ] the Utility/Helper class concept - like Math and all the drills we've done so far
  - [ ] not in text, but good Quora answer here: <https://qr.ae/TWKmyo>
- [ ] Java objects intro, in particular
  - [ ] state (not in text, but can be found in many other places, like <https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/concepts/object.html>)
  - [ ] non-static methods
  - [ ] instance variables/fields
    - [ ] (text 8.2)

### Utility / Helper classes

- [ ] Math
- [ ] look at our other drills; notice the use of static
- [ ] a pile of static methods that are related thrown into a class
- [ ] some consider this a bad practice, but....
- [ ] diagram what the source file of a non-utility class looks like
  - [ ] here's the [actual Math source code](http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk8/jdk8/jdk/file/687fd7c7986d/src/share/classes/java/lang/Math.java)

### Java objects

- [ ] demo...with props!
- [ ] notice how each thing has the same _behaviour_ (can be asked to do the same things with their methods), but also had something about them that was different? (that's their _state_)
- [ ] diagram what the source file of a non-utility class looks like (and compare to utility class)
  - [ ] here's the [actual String source code](http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk8/jdk8/jdk/file/687fd7c7986d/src/share/classes/java/lang/String.java)
