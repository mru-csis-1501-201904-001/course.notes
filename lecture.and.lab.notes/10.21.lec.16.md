# 1501-001 Lecture Notes

## [OCT-21] Lec-16

- [ ] final exam schedule released
- [ ] gaps between w/ drill and w/o drill marks
- [ ] moved some drills around so you could get ready for the lab quiz

### Topics to cover

- [ ] code review of week-05 drills
- [ ] loop pseudocode notation
- [ ] method overloading - I'm telling you this for a reason!
  - [ ] example 1: the [Pringles trace](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L0LSt4es4uQ4qIdRLSWJpFv1lKqRsRTmZhV1PhAcqLw/edit?usp=sharing)
  - [ ] example 2: the Scanner constructor
    - [ ] new Scanner(System.in)
    - [ ] new Scanner(String)
  - [ ] example 3 - not just constructors!: the String class' substring method
    - [ ] substring(int, int)
    - [ ] substring(int)
  - [ ] example 4: Reaction drill - change defaultRedaction and customRedaction to one redaction method:
    - [ ] redactedStatement(String statement, String toRedact)
    - [ ] redactedStatement(String statement, String toRedact, String redactionSymbol)

## Lecture Lookback

### Review

- [ ] write **pseudocode** that would:

  - [ ] prompt a user for an age until they gave you a number between 0 and 99
  - [ ] print a word given by a user out to the screen as an ever-increasing sequence of letters. For example, if the word was "hoopla", then the algorithm should display:

  ```text
    h
    ho
    hoo
    hoop
    hoopl
    hoopla
  ```

  - [ ] echo words from a file to the screen until the end of file was reached

- [ ] practice overloading:
  - [ ] add an additional no-arg constructor to DutchBlitzCard that would initialize a card that was ("blue", "girl", 10)
  - [ ] add two additional constructors to HexMap: one (int, int) constructor that inits the player's position to the given ints, and another (no-arg) that inits the player's position to 0,0
  - [ ] overload responseToBringRequest(int) and responseToMakeRequest(int) from the Scone Butler drill so that they are no-arg and use some default value you choose

### Terms

- [ ] method overloading [special topic 8.2 in text]
- [ ] while loop
- [ ] for loop
