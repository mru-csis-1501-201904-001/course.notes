# 1501-001 Lab Notes

## [SEP-20] Lab-04

### Before we begin

- [ ] reminder that next week is the lab and lecture quiz; on the bright side, there are only 2 short drills (you are expected to look up the if statement syntax on your own)

### Topics to cover

- [ ] method signatures and method return type - figuring 'em out from a call
- [ ] lab quiz calm-down: getting you (more) ready for the quiz next week

### method signatures & method return type

- [ ] what is a method signature? return type?
- [ ] sussing then out from a completed method (header)
- [ ] figuring them out from a call to it

### lab quiz calm-down

- [ ] for the first two quizzes, I will help with Eclipse-related issues
- [ ] the "real" quiz is **very** similar to the practice ones; this is by design
- [ ] if you've done the week-01 drills, you've got the skills (look at me rhyming)
- [ ] let's grab a practice quiz and talk about a few things:
  - [ ] go import lab.quiz.01.practice.01 into Eclipse (if it takes you a long time, guess what you're doing this weekend?)
  - [ ] setup suggestions (both monitors, submit tab, instruction tab, eclipse)
  - [ ] how to read syntax errors
  - [ ] how to run the tests & interpret the error messages

## Lab Lookback

### Review

- [ ] go back and look at the drills for week-01 and 02...write down the method signature and return type for each method you've coded

### Terms

- [ ] method signature
