# 1501-001 Lab Notes

## [OCT-01] Lab-07

### Before we begin

### Topics to cover

- [ ] when == isn't equals (briefly hinted at in lecture)
- [ ] "family members" (other instances of your class) **can** access your instance variable directly

## `==`vs. `.equals`

- [ ] <https://repl.it/@jpratt/SpecializedBreakableTruespace>
- [ ] so what's the takeaway? how do we fix our `hasSameSymbol` as?

## accessing "family member" fields

- [ ] same repl ... see `hasSameSymbol(SimplifiedBlitzCard)` method

---

## Lab Lookback

Dagnabbit....the example I gave (on the REPL) was too complex. Should have just done an "enter a name at the keyboard and compare to a string". Booooo. And I didn't really have time to talk about accessing family member instance variables either.

On the plus side:

- there were a lot of folks in attendance, even now that we're going into our fourth week
- people were working hard on the drills, struggling...and moving forward

### Review

### Terms

- [ ] equals() [textbook: 3.2]
- [ ] equalsIgnoreCase()
